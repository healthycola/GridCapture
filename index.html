<p>Grid Capture is a very simple game that I developed recently. It was an excuse for me to get my hands dirty with HTML5 (specifically <code>canvas</code>) and javascript, since I've never really used either before.</p>

<h3>
<a name="purpose-of-the-game" class="anchor" href="#purpose-of-the-game"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose of the game</h3>

<p>The purpose of the game is quite simple. You play with another person, and each person gets a turn. On their turn, they are allowed to select one un-captured line on the grid. This line belongs to them. When a player captures a line which creates a complete square, they have captured a square. They also get another turn. Otherwise, it is the other playerâ€™s turn.</p>

<a name="areas-of-improvement" class="anchor" href="#areas-of-improvement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Areas of improvement</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of things that the game needs and that I've planned out for it. I've listed them below.</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Add a settings panel for players to change their names and colours</li>
<li>[ ] In the settings panel, also include a method to change the grid size</li>
<li>[ ] Add support for more than 2 players to play at a time</li>
<li>[ ] Add multi-player server support such that two (or more) players can play at the same time on different computers</li>
</ul>
