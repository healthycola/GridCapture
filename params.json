{"name":"Gridcapture","tagline":"A fun game in which your objective is to capture the most number of squares in the grid.","body":"### Welcome to GridCapture\r\nGrid Capture is a very simple game that I developed recently. It was an excuse for me to get my hands dirty with HTML5 (specifically `canvas`) and javascript, since I've never really used either before.\r\n\r\n### Purpose of the game\r\nThe purpose of the game is quite simple. You play with another person, and each person gets a turn. On their turn, they are allowed to select one un-captured line on the grid. This line belongs to them. When a player captures a line which creates a complete square, they have captured a square. They also get another turn. Otherwise, it is the other playerâ€™s turn.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n### Areas of improvement\r\nThere are a bunch of things that the game needs and that I've planned out for it. I've listed them below.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a settings panel for players to change their names and colours\r\n- [ ] In the settings panel, also include a method to change the grid size\r\n- [ ] Add support for more than 2 players to play at a time\r\n- [ ] Add multi-player server support such that two (or more) players can play at the same time on different computers","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
